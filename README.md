# The Last Tweet: A Twitter Survival Game
Welcome to our project, The Last Tweet! This text-based adventure game was built by Brenden King, Mohamed Omar, and 
Patrick Lauer during the August 22nd 2022 SDE Cohort program, presented by TLG Learning! 

# Summary
The concept of this game is that you are one of the last survivors of the Twitter office during the Great Twitter 
Purge of 2022. Your goal is to survive the ravages of the Twitter office by producing code, satiating your hunger,
holding on to your sanity, and ultimately staying employed! 

# IMPORTANT
We as the developers would like to personally stress that this project is simply a parody of current 
events that occurred during this time, and is not meant to present any ill will to Elon Musk himself.

# Setup
We hope you enjoy this game in its current build! Depending on your system and available applications, there may
be some setup required, in which case we recommend checking out [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md).
